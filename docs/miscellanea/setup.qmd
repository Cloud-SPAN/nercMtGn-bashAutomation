# Overview

The software and data used for analysis during the course are hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine (VM) instance. A copy of such instance that requires no previous setup by you will be made available to you at no cost by the Cloud-SPAN team.

To accesss and use the resources in your AWS instance from your personal computer, you will use a command-line interface (**CLI**) program that is widely known as the **shell** or **terminal**. The shell is available by default for Linux and Mac users (so they don't need to install any software).

**Windows** users will need to install Git for Windows on their computer as described below **prior to the course**. Git includes **Git Bash** which is a Windows version of the Unix Bash shell, the most widely used shell and the default shell in Linux systems.

**Mac** users **may need to configure** the **terminal** to use the Bash shell as described below. Mac computers usually have installed both shell programs Zsh and Bash, and Zsh is the default shell used by the **terminal**. Unfortunately, Zsh may not be configured to locate the `ssh` program which you need to login to your instance. Configuring the terminal to use Bash solves the problem.

You will need to use a laptop or desktop to take this course. Due to the need both to follow the instructor in zoom and to perform analyses, **tablets** and **ipads are not suitable** for using during this course.  Having both an up to date browser and a stable internet connection is important.

Before the course you will receive via email the information that you will need to login to your AWS instance during the course.

## Configure your Terminal to use Bash --- Mac users
::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Configure the Terminal to use Bash (instead of Zsh)

The instructions below will guide you to configure your **terminal** to use the Bash shell. Do so only if you cannot login to your instance as described in the Episode [Logging onto the Cloud](https://cloud-span.github.io/nerc-metagenomics01-file-directories/02-logging-onto-cloud/index.html), and your  terminal displays the error message "**`ssh` command not found**" instead when trying to login.

You will also find below the instructions to revert your terminal configuration if you want to. Do so
only after you have finished the course.

#### **Configuring the terminal to use Bash**
First check that your terminal is actually running the Zsh shell. As shown in the screenshot below, the top bar of your terminal should show **zsh** next to your username on the right. If so, continue; otherwise get in touch with the Cloud-SPAN team.

<!-- WAS THIS <img src="/images/mac01.png" alt="Mac terminal running Zsh shell" width="600"/> -->

![Mac terminal running Zsh shell.](/images/mac01.png){width=500 fig-alt="Mac terminal running Zsh shell."}

Enter or copy-paste the `chsh` command as shown below, see also the screenshot --- `chsh` stands for "change shell":

```bash
% chsh -s /bin/bash                          # <1>
``` 
1. Change the terminal shell to bash.

![Mac terminal showing command to change to Bash shell.](/images/mac02.png){width=500 fig-alt="Mac terminal showing command to change to Bash shell."}

Enter your password when prompted to do so:

![Mac terminating showing prompt for password.](/images/mac03.png){width=500 fig-alt="Mac terminating showing prompt for password."}

The change you have made will take effect once you open a new terminal (you can close the terminal where you run the `chsh` command). Once you open a new you terminal, check that it displays **bash** in the top bar as in the screenshot below:

![Mac terminal showing "bash" at the top bar.](/images/mac04.png){width=500 fig-alt="Mac terminal showing \"bash\" at the top bar."}

Note that new terminals that you open will show the message:\
**The default interactive shell is now zsh**.\
**To update your account to use zsh, please run 'chsh -s /bin/zsh'.**

Just ignore it.

You should now be able to login to your instance in the cloud. If not, get in touch with the Cloud-SPAN team.

#### **Configuring the terminal back to use Zsh**
Once you finish the course, if want revert your terminal to its previous configuration, enter or copy-paste the `chsh` command below into a terminal and enter your password when prompted, see the screenshot:

```bash
% chsh -s /bin/zsh                          # <1>
```
1. Change the terminal shell to zsh.

![Mac terminal showing command to change to Zsh shell.](/images/mac05.png){width=500 fig-alt="Mac terminal showing command to change to Zsh shell."}

Open a new terminal and check that **zsh** is displayed in the top bar of the terminal:
